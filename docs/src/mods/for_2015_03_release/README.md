We are attempting to coordinate a translation of the documentation away from Word docs.  Go ahead and drop in any documentation changes here for new features **once they are merged into develop**.  Once the 8.2 docs are translated, I'll probably end up manually merging the changes in from this folder, and then the new format documentation sources will be in NREL/EnergyPlus itself.
