EnergyPlus Experienced Modelers Workshop.pdf
Title:		EnergyPlus Introductory Workshop for Experienced Modelers
Subject:	The objective of this course is to introduce EnergyPlus to experienced modelers.  The emphasis of the material will be on aspects of EnergyPlus that differ substantially from other common modeling tools (e.g., DOE-2 and BLAST), such as the use of a multiple time-step approach, the integrated simulation of loads, systems and plant, and defining fluid and air loops.  The DOE-2 and BLAST translators in EnergyPlus will also be reviewed.
