Miscellaneous EnergyPlus information for Linux operating systems
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Note:
    In the following text % is the command prompt.

  There are several scripts which can be used to run various parts of the program:
  
  runenergyplus -- will use an input file or input macro file and run the program as
                   well as create .csv files (ReadVarsESO) and .svg files (HVAC-Diagram)
                   It stores the output on the same directory as the input files, by default.
  runreadvars -- can be used to create a csv file from your outputs (eso, mtr)
  runepmacro -- uses an input macro file (imf) and will create an idf for later use
  energyplus -- This is the actual EnergyPlus executable, and it is typically not called directly.
  
  To run a EnergyPlus simulation from the command line, do the following:

    Run the EnergyPlus command line script:

      % runenergyplus <inputfilename> <weatherfilename>

    <inputfilename> is the name of the input file or input macro file 
    (idf,imf).  it can contain a full or relative path
    
    <weatherfilename> is the name of the weather file.

    To see what weather files are installed, run

      % energyplus --weather

    This displays all available weather files.

    EnergyPlus searches for weather files in the weatherfiles directory
    of the EnergyPlus installation.

    The $ENERGYPLUS_WEATHER environment variable can be set to include
    additional weather files.
    
    The run script automatically runs the readvarseso program for
    .eso and .mtr files.

  For post-processing EnergyPlus results, type
      % readvarseso <FileName>
  where <FileName> is the name of the .rvi, .mvi, or .eso file,
  including file extension.
