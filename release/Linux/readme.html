<h2>EnergyPlus</h2>
<p><b>What it is, What it is not</b></p>
<p>EnergyPlus is a simulation program designed for modeling buildings with all their associated heating, cooling, lighting, ventilating, and other energy flows. EnergyPlus is a stand-alone simulation
engine without a 'user friendly' graphical interface . . . EnergyPlus reads input and writes output as text files.</p>
<p>Many graphical user interfaces for EnergyPlus are available or under development, including

<p>A number of third-party tools are available to create EnergyPlus input files (IDF).  These include

and <a href="http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/%7Eyzhang/wiki/doku.php?id=software:java:jeplus">jEPlus</a>.
Some of these may produce out of date IDF files; you can then use the IDFVersionUpdater program to convert older files to current EnergyPlus version (you may need to use the Multiple Version Conversions set -- see below.</p>
<p><i>EnergyPlus Example File Generator:</i> A Web-based service is available that creates and runs EnergyPlus input files for simple models of commercial buildings. The input files (and annual results summary files) are sent to your e-mail address as attachments. This is a pilot project and is currently made available only as a BETA service. You can access the service and customize the characteristics of the building you want to model on the <a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/inputs/index.cfm">EnergyPlus Example File Generator Application</a></p>
<p>See <a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/energyplus_addons.cfm">EnergyPlus Add-ons</a> for more information on tools available for EnergyPlus, including some features that are too big to include in the install.</p>
<h3>What's going on in V8.1?</h3>
<p><i>Will there be any considerable difference between version 8.0 and 8.1?</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal>Yes.... and no.&nbsp; The basic structure of EnergyPlus is
still as it has been but there are some significant changes that you will want
to be aware of:</p>
<p>As always, there are a number of new features and bug fixes. The highlights of features for this version are listed below&mdash;see <a href=
"http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/energyplus_features.cfm">EnergyPlus Features Page</a> for a complete list of new features added in
this and previous versions:</p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>How about IDF and IDD? Do they remain unchanged?</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal>There are a few key changes in the V8.1 IDD. For best
results, use the transition program to transfer from the earlier V8.0 files. Use the IDFVersionUpdater program for best results.
<p><i>Is version 8.1 backward compatible? Can I run v8.0 file in v8.1?</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal>There have been changes in the following objects which require conversion. Either read and follow the Rules spreadsheet or use the IDFVersionUpdater utility.  The “Rules” spreadsheet that contains information on exact object
changes that you can do by hand.
For the v8.1 release, the following objects require conversion (from V8.0):
<li>People (if using Thermal Comfort)</li>
<li>CoolingTower:SingleSpeed</li>
<li>CoolingTower:TwoSpeed</li>
<li>EvaporativeFluidCooler:TwoSpeed</li>
<li>FluidCooler:TwoSpeed</li>
<li>EvaporativeFluidCooler:SingleSpeed</li>
<li>HeatPump:WaterToWater:EquationFit:Heating</li>
<li>HeatPump:WaterToWater:EquationFit:Cooling</li>
<li>HeatPump:WaterToWater:ParameterEstimation:Cooling</li>
<li>HeatPump:WaterToWater:ParameterEstimation:Heating</li>
<li>HVACTemplate:Zone:PTAC (if still using keywords Continuous or Cycling)</li>
<li>HVACTemplate:Zone:PTHP (if still using keywords Continuous or Cycling)</li>
<li>HVACTemplate:Zone:WaterToAirHeatPump (if still using keywords Continuous or Cycling)</li>
<li>HVACTemplate:System:Unitary (if still using keywords Continuous or Cycling)</li>
<li>HVACTemplate:System:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir (if still using keywords Continuous or Cycling)</li>
</blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal>There are several changes in the object structures. You can
also view the ObjectStatus spreadsheet in the root folder of the installed
version.  This file has detailed explanations of changes to the objects.  There
is also the “Rules” spreadsheet that contains information on exact object
changes that you can do by hand – for best results, the included conversion (utility IDFVersionUpdater)
program can be used.  The updater program is described more fully in the
Auxiliary Programs document. The next section describes how to get the set of programs for multiple version conversions.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>In addition, as happens in every EnergyPlus release, there are new checks on user input. Even if your file ran in an earlier version, it may not run in the newer version after conversion due to newer checks on the validity of input.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Multiple Version Conversions</h3>
<p>The install includes the IDFVersionUpdater program and the necessary programs to convert from the previous version (including .rvi and .mvi files) to the current version. For older versions, you will need to visit the helpdesk and download the multiple conversion set of programs. The HelpDesk downloads area: <a href="http://energyplus.helpserve.com/Knowledgebase/List/Index/46/converting-older-version-files">Converting Older Files</a> will contain the necessary readmes and zip/tar files of programs to convert IDFs from V1.0 to the current version.</p>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>The documentation package included with EnergyPlus addresses all aspects of using EnergyPlus from user input to output examples to outside developer (module and interface) to internal programming
standards. It has been fully updated with this release. Though documentation is tagged as an optional component of the EnergyPlus install, it is a very important part
of EnergyPlus.<br>
Documents open with bookmarks and pages (PDF option) and open at the first page of text (rather than table of contents). The documents have embedded "named destinations" to facilitate direct access to topics.&nbsp;<br>
<p><i><b>EnergyPlus Documentation is searchable!</b></i> Using the indexing capabilities of Acrobat along with the search button on the main menu document, you can literally enter in a word and find all the occurrences of that word within the  pages of EnergyPlus documents. <b><span style='color:red'>(The search file capability was built in Acrobat Version X.&nbsp; There may be some
issues with using either version 7 or version 8 &ndash; we have tested in both versions and searches seem to be okay).&nbsp</span></b></p>
<p>There are some other documents of interest available on the web site including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Testing and Validation Reports: <a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/energyplus_testing.cfm">EnergyPlus Testing and Validation Reports
</a></li>
<li>Papers and Articles: <a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/energyplus_research.cfm">EnergyPlus Research Papers and Articles</a></li>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Weather Data</h3>
<p>A small subset of weather files that are available on the web site are also installed in the WeatherData folder. EnergyPlus uses these files directly for annual simulations.&nbsp;The Weather
Converter program that is part of EnergyPlus can read these weather files and provide .csv (comma separated variable) as well as statistics reports about the included (or other) files.&nbsp;
<b>Weather data</b> for more than 2100 locations in more than 100 countries can be downloaded on the <a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata_about.cfm">DOE EnergyPlus web site
weather data page</a>.</p>

<h2>Known problems</h2>
<p>While every effort has been made to clean up all the &ldquo;defects&rdquo; that have occurred during our testing, quite a few known (and even more unknown) probably remain. Specifics on the
remaining known problems can be found in the main EnergyPlus folder &ndash; html file: <a href="Known_Issues-V8-1-0.html">Known_Issues-V8-1-0.html</a>. If you are interested in what has been addressed, the issues resolved in this release are
installed similarly in &ndash; html file <a href="Addressed_Issues-V8-1-0.html">Addressed_Issues-V8-1-0.html</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes known issues are too large or complicated to be addressed in a simple change. These large scope issues then get moved to our enhancment list and addressed as specific projects as priorities and funds allow. To that end, we provide a list of these for the current release cycle, again, found in the main EnergyPlus folder &ndash; html file <a href="Enhancement_List_Items-V8-1-0.html">Enhancement_List_Items-V8-1-0.html</a>.</p>
