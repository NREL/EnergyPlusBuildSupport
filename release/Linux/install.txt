----------------------------------------------------------------------------

OPTIONAL SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES
---------------------------

   1. bash - The support programs that are distributed with this software are 
      Bash shell scripts. To use these scripts you will need to have the Bash
      shell installed on your system.

   2. A PDF viewer (ie. Adobe Reader) to view documentation files.


INSTALL ENERGYPLUS
---------------------------
   1. Download the EnergyPlus software from the following link. 

   2. The download is a self extracting archive. After the download is 
      complete, make the downloaded file executable by running the command 
      (where % is the command prompt and <version> is the current version of 
      EnergyPlus): 
      %   chmod +x SetEPlusV810009-lin.sh

   3. The default install location is /usr/local, therefore the installer must 
      be executed with administrative privileges. Assuming your account has 
      administrative rights, enter:
      %   sudo ./SetEPlusV810009-lin.sh
      Alternatively, you can install without administrative privileges, but 
      custom paths must be entered when prompted. To install without
      administrative rights enter:
      %   ./SetEPlusV810009-lin.sh

   4. Enter your admin password if required by sudo.

   5. The installer will prompt for the installation path. Type the enter key 
      to accept the default install location. EnergyPlus will be installed to
      a directory named EnergyPlus-8-1-0.

   6. The installer will prompt for a path where symbolic links will be
      created to the software executables. The default is /usr/local/bin.
      Type the enter key to accept the default link location.

   7. If symbolic links were created to a location in your path
      (ie. /usr/local/bin ), the installation is complete.
      Type the following for further information on running the included
      scripts.
      %   runenergyplus --help
      %   energyplus --help
      %   readvarseso --help

   8. If EnergyPlus was installed to a non standard location, you may need to
      modify the PATH environment variable to point to the bin directory of
      the EnergyPlus installation. See your distributions documentation for
      instructions on setting the PATH variable.

UNINSTALL ENERGYPLUS
---------------------------
To uninstall EnergyPlus, execute the uninstall.sh script in the EnergyPlus
installation directory. This script will remove any symbolic links pointing
to the installation. After the symbolic links are removed, you may remove the
EnergyPlus-8-1-0 directory to completely remove the installed software.
