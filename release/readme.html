EnergyPlus is a stand-alone simulationengine without a 'user friendly' graphical interface . . . EnergyPlus reads input and writes output as text files.</p><p>Utilities and tools for creating, editing, and running input files that come with EnergyPlus include IDF Editor and EP-Launch. Many graphical user interfaces for EnergyPlus are available or under development, including<a href="http://openstudio.nrel.gov">Open Studio</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/openstudio.cfm">Legacy OpenStudio</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://simergy-beta.lbl.gov/">Simergy</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://export-to-energyplus.en.cype.com/">CYPE CAD MEP</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/">DesignBuilder</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.designbuildersoftware.com/efen.php">EFEN</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bentley.com/en-US/Products/AECOsim+Energy+Simulator/">AECOsim Energy Simulator</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bentley.com/en-US/Products/Hevacomp+Dynamic+Simulation/">Hevacomp</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smartenergysoftware.com/htmlwebsite/default.aspx">SMART ENERGY</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coolshadow.com/EPlusInterface/">EPlusInterface</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.lbl.gov/software/comfen/comfen.html">COMFEN</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.solarshoebox.com">Solar Shoe Box</a>,&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.expertapp.com/index.php">N++</a>.</p><p>A number of third-party tools are available to create EnergyPlus input files (IDF).  These include<a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/ecotect-analysis/">ECOTECT</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.energyplugged.it/">EnergyPlugged</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.natural-works.com/energyplus/interface.php">EP-GEO &amp; EP-SYS</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.glazersoftware.com/ep-quick.htm">EP-Quick</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/Programs/ESP-r.htm">ESP-r</a>,&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/%7Eyzhang/wiki/doku.php?id=software:java:jeplus">jEPlus</a>.Some of these may produce out of date IDF files; you can then use the IDFVersionUpdater program to convert older files to current EnergyPlus version (you may need to use the Multiple Version Conversions set -- see below.</p><p><i>EnergyPlus Example File Generator:</i> A Web-based service is available that creates and runs EnergyPlus input files for simple models of commercial buildings. The input files (and annual results summary files) are sent to your e-mail address as attachments. This is a pilot project and is currently made available only as a BETA service. You can access the service and customize the characteristics of the building you want to model on the <a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/inputs/index.cfm">EnergyPlus Example File Generator Application</a></p><p>See <a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/energyplus_addons.cfm">EnergyPlus Add-ons</a> for more information on tools available for EnergyPlus, including some features that are too big to include in the install.</p><h3>What's going on in V8.1?</h3><p><i>Will there be any considerable difference between version 8.0 and 8.1?</i></p><blockquote><p class=MsoNormal>Yes.... and no.&nbsp; The basic structure of EnergyPlus isstill as it has been but there are some significant changes that you will wantto be aware of:</p><p>As always, there are a number of new features and bug fixes. The highlights of features for this version are listed below&mdash;see <a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/energyplus_features.cfm">EnergyPlus Features Page</a> for a complete list of new features added inthis and previous versions:</p><p></p></blockquote><p><i>How about IDF and IDD? Do they remain unchanged?</i></p><blockquote><p class=MsoNormal>There are a few key changes in the V8.1 IDD. For bestresults, use the transition program to transfer from the earlier V8.0 files. Use the IDFVersionUpdater program for best results.<p><i>Is version 8.1 backward compatible? Can I run v8.0 file in v8.1?</i></p><blockquote><p class=MsoNormal>There have been changes in the following objects which require conversion. Either read and follow the Rules spreadsheet or use the IDFVersionUpdater utility.  The “Rules” spreadsheet that contains information on exact objectchanges that you can do by hand.For the v8.1 release, the following objects require conversion (from V8.0):<li>People (if using Thermal Comfort)</li><li>CoolingTower:SingleSpeed</li><li>CoolingTower:TwoSpeed</li><li>EvaporativeFluidCooler:TwoSpeed</li><li>FluidCooler:TwoSpeed</li><li>EvaporativeFluidCooler:SingleSpeed</li><li>HeatPump:WaterToWater:EquationFit:Heating</li><li>HeatPump:WaterToWater:EquationFit:Cooling</li><li>HeatPump:WaterToWater:ParameterEstimation:Cooling</li><li>HeatPump:WaterToWater:ParameterEstimation:Heating</li><li>HVACTemplate:Zone:PTAC (if still using keywords Continuous or Cycling)</li><li>HVACTemplate:Zone:PTHP (if still using keywords Continuous or Cycling)</li><li>HVACTemplate:Zone:WaterToAirHeatPump (if still using keywords Continuous or Cycling)</li><li>HVACTemplate:System:Unitary (if still using keywords Continuous or Cycling)</li><li>HVACTemplate:System:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir (if still using keywords Continuous or Cycling)</li></blockquote><p class=MsoNormal>There are several changes in the object structures. You canalso view the ObjectStatus spreadsheet in the root folder of the installedversion.  This file has detailed explanations of changes to the objects.  Thereis also the “Rules” spreadsheet that contains information on exact objectchanges that you can do by hand – for best results, the included conversion (utility IDFVersionUpdater)program can be used.  The updater program is described more fully in theAuxiliary Programs document. The next section describes how to get the set of programs for multiple version conversions.</p><p class=MsoNormal>In addition, as happens in every EnergyPlus release, there are new checks on user input. Even if your file ran in an earlier version, it may not run in the newer version after conversion due to newer checks on the validity of input.</p></blockquote><h3>Multiple Version Conversions</h3><p>The install includes the IDFVersionUpdater program and the necessary programs to convert from the previous version (including .rvi and .mvi files) to the current version. For older versions, you will need to visit the helpdesk and download the multiple conversion set of programs. The HelpDesk downloads area: <a href="http://energyplus.helpserve.com/Knowledgebase/List/Index/46/converting-older-version-files">Converting Older Files</a> will contain the necessary readmes and zip/tar files of programs to convert IDFs from V1.0 to the current version.</p><h3>Documentation</h3><p>The documentation package included with EnergyPlus addresses all aspects of using EnergyPlus from user input to output examples to outside developer (module and interface) to internal programmingstandards. It has been fully updated with this release. Though documentation is tagged as an optional component of the EnergyPlus install, it is a very important partof EnergyPlus.<br>Documents open with bookmarks and pages (PDF option) and open at the first page of text (rather than table of contents). The documents have embedded "named destinations" to facilitate direct access to topics.&nbsp;<br>EnergyPlus documentation may be accessed one of two ways:</p><ul><li>From the <b>Start Menu</b>, select <b>Programs</b>, <b>EnergyPlus Programs</b>, <b>EnergyPlus Documentation Main Menu</b> (Note - if you selected a different name for the program group, the itemswill be in that group.)</li><li>Or locate the EnergyPlus installation directory, go to the Documentation folder, and open the file "<a href="Documentation/EPlusMainMenu.pdf">EPlusMainMenu.pdf</a>". (<i><b>The documents are produced in Acrobat X (aka 10). You must have AcrobatReader Version 7/8/9 (or equivalent -- compliant with reading documents encrypted with Acrobat 7) installed on your system to access the EnergyPlus documentation. We recommend Reader 7 at minimum.</b></i>)</li><li>The documentation is also accessible from the <b>Help</b> menu in EP-Launch and IDF-Editor.</li></ul><p><i><b>EnergyPlus Documentation is searchable!</b></i> Using the indexing capabilities of Acrobat along with the search button on the main menu document, you can literally enter in a word and find all the occurrences of that word within the  pages of EnergyPlus documents. <b><span style='color:red'>(The search file capability was built in Acrobat Version X.&nbsp; There may be someissues with using either version 7 or version 8 &ndash; we have tested in both versions and searches seem to be okay).&nbsp</span></b></p><p>There are some other documents of interest available on the web site including:</p><ul><li>Testing and Validation Reports: <a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/energyplus_testing.cfm">EnergyPlus Testing and Validation Reports</a></li><li>Papers and Articles: <a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/energyplus_research.cfm">EnergyPlus Research Papers and Articles</a></li></li></ul><h3>Weather Data</h3><p>A small subset of weather files that are available on the web site are also installed in the WeatherData folder. EnergyPlus uses these files directly for annual simulations.&nbsp;The WeatherConverter program that is part of EnergyPlus can read these weather files and provide .csv (comma separated variable) as well as statistics reports about the included (or other) files.&nbsp;<b>Weather data</b> for more than 2100 locations in more than 100 countries can be downloaded on the <a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata_about.cfm">DOE EnergyPlus web siteweather data page</a>.</p><h3>Highlights of this release (V8.1.0.009)</h3><p>The highlights &ndash; improved and new features &ndash; are displayed by category.</p><blockquote><h4>General</h4><ul><li>Bug fixes throughout.</li></ul><h4>Datasets</h4><ul><li>New data set for residential air-conditioner and heat pump performance curves.</li><li>"   2013 ASHRAE Design Conditions files (Annual and Monthly) available from Helpdesk.</li></ul><!--<h4>Design Day</h4><ul><li></li></ul>--><h4>Input</h4><ul><li>Allow ZoneList for Steam and Other Equipment internal gains.</li></ul><!--<h4>Geometry/Window/Wall/Shading</h4><ul><li></li></ul>--><h4>Windows and Daylighting</h4><ul><li>New option for windows based on ASHWAT model.</li><li>New zone daylight distribution model when using complex fenestration systems. </li><li>User-definable solar and visible spectrum weighting functions.</li></ul><h4>Zone and Surface Models</h4><ul><li>Dynamic clothing model for People thermal comfort. </li><li>Pre-calculated solar heat gains on inside faces of surfaces can be scheduled.</li><li>EMS actuators for outdoor air conditions for surface outside face heat transfer modeling boundary conditions.</li></ul><h4>Natural and Mechanical Ventilation</h4><ul><li>Cross ventilation natural ventilation model improved.</li></ul><h4>HVAC and Refrigeration</h4><ul><li>A unitary system with multispeed AC and multistage gas furnace</li><li>Comprehensive model for unitary HVAC systems. </li><li>Packaged thermal storage cooling coil.</li><li>Variable speed cooling tower based on Merkel model.</li><li>Zone forced air unit for evaporative coolers. </li><li>Central dedicated outdoor air serving fan coil units.</li><li>HVACTemplate for new comprehensive unitary system.</li><li>HVACTemplate for zone baseboard heaters.</li><li>HVACTemplate for heat and cool VAV terminals.</li><li>HVACTemplate for constant volume systems (non-unitary).</li><li>HVACTemplate for variable refrigerant flow equipment.</li><li>HVACTemplate for dual duct systems. </li><li>Expanded HVACTemplate options including ideal loads outdoor air and humidity controls, baseboard heat with all system types, fancoil controls, return fans, and fan powered VAV recirculation from plenum.</li></ul><h4>Controls and User Functions</h4><ul><li>Staged zone thermostat.</li><li>On/off setpoint managers for single zone heating and cooling.</li><li>User-defined plant equipment operation scheme based on EMS.</li><li>HVAC system optimal start control.</li><li>Operational fault modeling for air economizer control sensor offset.</li></ul><h4>Output</h4><ul><li>Component model sizing diagnostics for easily comparing user-specified values to autosized values.</li></ul><h4>Utilities</h4><ul><li>Weather Converter &ndash; produces 2013 design day files for appropriate locations.</li></ul><h4>Documentation and Guides</h4><ul><li>New document Plant Application Guide.</li><li>Documentation has been updated for all documents.</li></ul><!--<h4>Validation and Testing</h4><ul><li>New EnergyPlus Testing Reports:</li><li><i>EnergyPlus Testing with IEA BESTEST Mechanical Equipment & Control Strategies for a Chilled Water and a Hot Water System</i></li></ul>--><h4>Platforms</h4><ul><li>Windows (XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8) 32 and 64 bit versions</li><li>Linux (Ubuntu 12.04 and compatible) 32 and 64 bit versions; RHEL 5.0 compatible available on request via helpdesk.</li><li>Mac (10.7 and 10.8) 64 bit versions</li><li>EnergyPlus V8.1 has been tested on all of these platforms</li><li><i>EnergyPlus does intensive computations, for high performance, computers should have a lot of memory and fast hard disk speeds.</i></li></ul><p>And many other enhancements throughout.</p></blockquote><h2>Installation contents</h2><p>The installation creates a program folder with icons/shortcuts for the programs/files in EnergyPlus that can be accessed from Windows menus, including removing EnergyPlus from yoursystem. In Windows OS, these will be available from the "Programs" area in the Start Menu. Note that only a fewof the programs will store anything in your Windows\System directory (IDFEditor, EPLaunch, WeatherConverter).</p><h2>Known problems</h2><p>While every effort has been made to clean up all the &ldquo;defects&rdquo; that have occurred during our testing, quite a few known (and even more unknown) probably remain. Specifics on theremaining known problems can be found in the main EnergyPlus folder &ndash; html file: <a href="Known_Issues-V8-1-0.html">Known_Issues-V8-1-0.html</a>. If you are interested in what has been addressed, the issues resolved in this release areinstalled similarly in &ndash; html file <a href="Addressed_Issues-V8-1-0.html">Addressed_Issues-V8-1-0.html</a>.</p><p>Sometimes known issues are too large or complicated to be addressed in a simple change. These large scope issues then get moved to our enhancment list and addressed as specific projects as priorities and funds allow. To that end, we provide a list of these for the current release cycle, again, found in the main EnergyPlus folder &ndash; html file <a href="Enhancement_List_Items-V8-1-0.html">Enhancement_List_Items-V8-1-0.html</a>.</p><h2>Thanks</h2><p>Special thanks to our beta testers for this release.</p><p>Thanks for downloading and registering EnergyPlus.
