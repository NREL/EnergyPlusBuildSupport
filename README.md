======================
This repository was previously used to store package-related items that weren't in the main source repo.  Issues with this workflow led to moving all the package pieces into the main repo after all.  This repo is not used anymore, however we will leave it up for the time being.  The current state of the master branch is empty outside of this README.  There are tags for prior versions of E+ (back to 8.2) so that packages could still be made for those if needed.
